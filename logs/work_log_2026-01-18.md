# Work Log - 2026-01-18

## 1. Accomplishments
- Initialized the BLE Scanner project using Python, `bleak`, and `flet`.
- Developed core BLE scanning logic with real-time UI updates.
- Implemented specialized UUID decoding logic:
    - **Literal Hex Segment Mode:** Combined the first 3 UUID segments (16 chars) as a phone number and the 4th segment as a card number.
    - **ASCII Fallback Mode:** Decoded hex segments to ASCII to search for phone/card patterns.
- Added a device name filter (Like search) to the UI.
- Provided a clean, toggleable "Start/Stop Scan" button with visual feedback (colors and icons).
- Fixed terminal warnings and errors (Attributes on `BLEDevice`, Flet deprecations, etc.).
- Integrated console logging for easy debugging of found devices.

## 2. Technical Challenges & Fixes
- **Flet Versioning:** Handled breaking changes in Flet 0.80.2 by using string-based styling and `ft.run()`.
- **Bleak Data Access:** Switched to `return_adv=True` in `BleakScanner.discover()` to reliably access `advertisement_data` (UUIDs and RSSI).
- **Async Handling:** Fixed a `RuntimeWarning` by using `page.run_task()` for non-awaited coroutines in button handlers.

## 3. Current State
- MVP code is functional in `main.py`.
- Environment is set up with a virtual environment (`venv`).
- Documentation includes `README.md` and initial `requirements.md`.

## 4. Tomorrow's Goals
- Fine-tune UUID parsing if more specific manufacturer data patterns are identified.
- Implement more robust GATT connection state management.
